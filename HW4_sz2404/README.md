## Homework Part 1
I followed instructions from professor's skeleton notebook and produced my other distritbutions.

I used different methods to obtain the sample sizes between 10 and 2000. Therefore, on top of different distribution, the pattern and distribution concentration of each can be very different due to the sample sizes. 

## Homework Part 1 - Extra Credit
I referred to links from stackflow also read in the Statistics in a Nutshell book about Gaussian distribution. 
For the Gaussian line, I used the function norm.pdf to obtain value from the y-axis. X-axis is based on all the means. 

## Homework Part 2
I found the usertype column demosntrates subcribers (people with long-term membership) versus customers (people who purchased 24-hour/3-day passes). So I want to explore tourists usage of CitiBikes on weekends vs weekdays. I also included the distribution of locals using Citibikes as contrasts. 

## Homework Part 3
I follow professor's instructure on how to calculate Z-test score and refer to the lecture slides about what criteria is being used and how to interpret it for null hypothesis rejection. 

## Collaboration 
I had a quick discussion with Professor Bianco regarding my null hypothese for the Citibike part. I also had discussion with Alia Kasem on all the parts and we shared some reference links for technical issues. 

## Reference
I have included all the reference links as # statements in my ipynb cells. Most technical supports are from Stackflow, Pandas Documentation, and Matlibplot Documentation (i.e. Specific Python Package documentation).
