# Homework 2 - Part 1
Perform the instruction in deleteData.md: delete data and its history from a GitHub repo.
I created a random txt file called Testing1. txt. Then I followed Dr. Bianco's lab (found here: https://github.com/fedhere/PUI2018_fb55/blob/master/HW3_fb55/deleteData.md) to force delete the file and it's traces in the history. 

Here's the screenshot of the file I created:

Here's the commands I used in the terminal for erasing the file and the history:

For this part, I used the try and except statements twice:
1. Some Select Bus Lines (possibly services interruption) have different data structure or no data. The first try and except statements are trying to seperate the different outputs for regular running buses and some interrupted service (for example, M34, M23). 
2. Sometimes, there will be no information for the location as buses are possibly not running. The second try and except statements are set up under the 'for loop' to distinguise buses that have valid location data versus not.

# Collaboration Statemnet:
Specials thanks to Ilyas Habeeb and Te Du:

I consulted Te Du (a previous CUSP student) to explain the for loop and how to use the Try and Except within it.

I discussed certain functions, i.e. if statement, with TA Ilyas Habeeb. Ilyas also explained the rotation for ticks in plotting function as well the instructions for the Extra Credit section. Ilyas also mentioned to me that the py script should cover situations where bus data is not available following running bus format.
